## Notes:

Amount of whitelist private period and any Pre-ICO gathering of funds are not part of the smart contract. Distribution of tokens from private period will be prior to the start of the ICO.

The Milestones defined in the whitepaper, will be manually added with the creation of the smart-contract of the ICO. This is because the tokens distributed at the private whitelist period and/or the Pre-ICO will be deducted from the 700 Million tokens available for the Crowdsale. The starting price of the ICO will depend on the remaining tokens.

## Example:

Example 1:
If 156 Million tokens where distributed prior to the ICO, the price of each DIW Token will start at 1 ETH = 10,526 DIW Tokens

Example 2:
If 220 Million tokens where distributed prior to the ICO, the price of each DIW Token will start at 1 ETH = 9,523 DIW Tokens

Example 3:
If 350 Million tokens where distributed prior to the ICO, the price of each DIW Token will start at 1 ETH = 8,695 DIW Tokens

The vesting period will be assigned manually to each team member and advisor after the ICO is concluded. The same vesting period will apply for future partners.
